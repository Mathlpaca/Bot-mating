Genetic programming using Aseba studio

Abstract

Experiment involving 8 mobile robots Thymio II wireless, which behavior and/or path is stochasticaly determined at each start.
The mobile behavior (phenotype), or it's trajectory, evolve with time, and can be exchanged and modified through mating. The number of individuals is fixed at the beginning, so the population remains stable, but offers however a live simulation of the evolution of a group through the variation of light and movement.
